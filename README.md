           Phase 5: Project Demonstration & Documentation

  Title:  AI - Structural Health Monitoring

Abstract

The Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) System aims to enhance infrastructure safety through continuous monitoring of structural parameters using IoT sensors, data analytics, and AI-based predictive modeling. The final phase integrates real-time data collection from strategically placed sensors on infrastructures (e.g., bridges, buildings), automated fault detection algorithms, and performance visualization dashboards. This documentation details the completed project, including demonstration insights, architecture, source code, testing outcomes, and user manuals. Screenshots and schematic representations are also included to provide a complete picture of the system’s capabilities and deployment readiness.


1. Project Demonstration
Overview:
The SHM system will be demonstrated to show its ability to monitor and analyze structural integrity through real-time sensor data. The system is capable of detecting anomalies like cracks, stress, and vibrations.
Demonstration Details:
•	System Walkthrough: A live walkthrough from sensor data capture to real-time dashboard analytics.
•	AI Anomaly Detection: The AI model will analyze sensor inputs to detect potential structural issues.
•	IoT Sensor Display: Real-time readings (vibration, strain, tilt, temperature) from IoT sensors will be shown.
•	Performance Metrics: System load handling, latency, and reliability under different environmental conditions.
•	Data Security: Encryption and secure protocols for data integrity and remote access will be demonstrated.




Outcome:
Stakeholders will see a working system that can provide early warnings for structural issues, ensuring public safety and infrastructure longevity.

2. Project Documentation
Overview:
Detailed documentation of the SHM system, explaining technical design, implementation strategies, and operational guidelines.
Documentation Sections:
•	System Architecture: Diagrams of sensor placement, data flow, and backend architecture.
•	Code Documentation: Source code with comments, including AI analysis modules and sensor interface scripts.
•	User Guide: Instructions for facility managers on reading alerts and responding to notifications.
•	Admin Guide: System configuration, maintenance procedures, and sensor calibration protocols.
•	Testing Reports: Validation results from stress simulations, failure detection accuracy, and real-time data performance.

Outcome:
